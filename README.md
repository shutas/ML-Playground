This repository includes all of the code I've written to follow along Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido, as well as any code written to personally explore the applications of ML.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Explained Python libraries to be used throughout the book. Introduced dataset format in sklearn's dataset modules. Given rough introduction to measuring success of machine learning model using training and testing data. Implemented an iris classifer using k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.
